## Full SWOT Analysis

### **üí™ Strengths**

- **Fast-Learners**: Although most of the team did not have prior web development skills, each developer demonstrated proficiency in HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript. Given a task and a goal, developers are willing to figure out the tools and knowledge necessary.
- **Quick Turnaround**: When given manageable bite-sized tasks, developers have a quick turnaround time. This may be because of the small scale of this project, but it demonstrates the efficiency with which the developers can work in short sprints.
- **Simple Design**: The team did not complicate the production of this project to unnecessary extents. Instead of focusing on complexity, we focused on simplicity and efficiency. We made sure to have a good, solid foundation before trying to do more advanced things.
- **Assigning Task-Specific Leads**: In the frontend team, we tried assigning task-specific leads (ex., HTML Lead, Figma Lead, etc.). This was very effective in equally distributing tasks, giving developers more of a reason to stay engaged, and encouraging developers to be proactive and take initiative. By assigning a ‚Äúlead‚Äù title, developers have more confidence in trusting their abilities and taking action.

### **ü§î Weaknesses**

- **Need for Encouragement**: The team seems to need an active ‚Äúpusher‚Äù to encourage the team to carry on and complete the tasks. Given too much leeway, the team falls behind a bit, and then the workflow pipeline gets clogged up. Sometimes developers are also unaware of what is required of them. To improve this, we may encourage developers to check Slack more and read over GitHub issues periodically.
- **Procrastination**: The team created more output and worked with greater efficiency when the deadline was approaching. This could be because the bulk of the assignment‚Äôs timeframe was during a weekday. During the weekends, there is more availability for meetings and greater bandwidth for working on this project.
- **Inter-Team Communication**: In the project, we had two teams ‚Äî frontend and backend. There was not enough opportunity for the two teams to converse and share visions of the final product. We had one all-hands meeting and then had our submeetings within our respective teams. The leads communicated with each other, but this may not have been enough to rope in all developers to the main goal.
- **Lack of Experience**: Given that most of the people in this group do not have web development experience and aren‚Äôt aware of the software development lifecycle, it was difficult to plot out a timeline and a good workflow for this assignment. With more time and experience with the tools/technologies we‚Äôre using for this class and experiencing the development cycle, we can improve our planning. There is room to grow, but we are confident that the team can do it.

### **üöÄ Opportunities**

- **Expandability of Current Project**: The project seems very easily expandable. Since we only had a week, it wasn‚Äôt feasible for the team to completely implement a blackjack game. However, there is a good chance that, given more time, the team could have created a more complex website. We have created a good foundation, which helps us later down the line
- **Larger Project in the Future**: Seeing that our developers are quick learners, it‚Äôs realistic to envision a larger, more complex project in the future. Collectively, we need to understand more about the Web Stack and also the software development lifecycle to more effectively plan and implement a more involved project.

### **üö® Threats**

- **Availability and Clashing Schedules**: As college students, most with 4 classes and other external commitments, it‚Äôs difficult for all of us to find times to meet and dedicate effort to CSE 110. Our group does have a recurring weekly meeting as a sync up, but we are still unsure if this is enough communication. Slack will be further prioritized to emphasize quick and optimal communication
- **Short Assignment Timeframe**: With only a week to complete the assignment, the timeframe for work is not enough to produce a fully polished product. If possible, it would be beneficial for the team leads if the instructional team of CSE 110 released assignments earlier to team leads so they can properly schedule meetings, timelines, and other time-sensitive activities.

### üëç Strategies for the Future

- Creating task-specific leads to promote commitment and proactivity
- Prior survey of skills to assess comfortability of technologies and gaps in understanding
- Better encouragement of Slack communication
- Soft and hard deadlines to curb procrastination

## **Summary of Learning:**

We have a strong team that is capable of creating a fully fleshed-out project. Through this quick sprint of a project, we learned that the team has some flaws in terms of procrastination. motivation, and communication. However, we also learned that the team is composed of fast learners who are committed to putting out good work. The team leads are still experimenting with new ways of management and simplifying the workflow. The developers are learning tools and technologies to create more industry-standard code and improve the quality of the main project coming up. The team has room to grow, but we are all understanding, respectful, and professional in how we operate.
