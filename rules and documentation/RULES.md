# 🛠️ Collaboration Rules & Local Development Guide

This project uses only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks or libraries.

---

## 📋 Collaboration Rules

To work smoothly as a team, follow these rules when contributing:

---

### 🧾 1. Claim a Task via GitHub Issues
- Go to the **Issues** tab in this repo
- Find or create a task
- Assign yourself and comment:  
  _"Taking this task – starting a branch soon!"_

---

### 🌿 2. Always Work on a New Branch (Not `main`)
- **Do NOT commit directly to `main`**
- Create your own feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-task-name
```

---

### 📦 3. Create a Pull Request (PR)
After completing your task:

1. Push your branch:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

2. Open a Pull Request (PR) to `main`

3. In your PR description, include:
   - ✅ What problem you solved
   - ✏️ What changes you made
   - 📸 Before/after screenshots (if visual)
   - 🙋 Ask for a review

---

### 🔍 4. Do Not Merge Without a Review
- Wait for at least **one teammate** to review your PR
- Once someone comments:  
  _“✅ Looks good to me!”_  
  → You may merge

---
